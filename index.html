    <h2>About</h2>
    <p><strong>Biography:</strong> I am a full stack web developer with experience
        in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. My background is in the hospitality industry where I
        have worked as an event planner for 6 years.</p>
        <br />

        <br />
        <p><strong>Education: </strong>I graduated from Washington State University
            at St. Louis with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration.
            After my undergraduate studies, I moved to San Francisco Bay Area to work for
            one year as a sales associate before moving back home to attend college again.
            In addition to being a Sales Associate, I also taught English classes at
            various schools throughout California. During this time, I was able to learn how
            to teach people about business and technology through speaking engagements.
            This has allowed me to gain valuable skills that will help me become a better
            programmer.</p>
            <br />

            <br />
            <p><strong>Work Experience:</strong> While attending university, I had the
                opportunity to be part of several different teams within the organization. One team member
                handled all aspects of customer service while another took care of inventory management.
                Another team member assisted customers by answering their questions regarding products or services.
                The other two roles were more technical but involved working on both front end and backend development.
                Both roles were very important to me because they helped keep track of customersâ€™ needs
                and provided them with products or services based on their preferences. These jobs gave me
                exposure into working with large groups of people and learning new things every day. The other job
                exposure into working with other individuals and groups within organizations. Throughout these experiences,
                insight into what it takes to run a successful company. The other job I held during my
                internship was working as a cashier at a local coffee shop. It was here when I
                learned more about managing money and keeping records of transactions. Throughout these two
                positions, I gained knowledge of accounting concepts such as debit/credit cards, taxes
                and banking systems. Overall, both experiences made me realize just how much work goes behind
                the scenes every day.</p>
